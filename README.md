# Fluent Python 2nd Edition Code Repository

This repository contains commented solutions and code examples from the book *Fluent Python 2nd Edition* by Luciano Ramalho. The code is organized following the book's structure, and each portion of code is designed to be executable through the terminal.

## Usage

To run the code, follow these general steps:

1. Navigate to the desired chapter's directory: `cd ChapterX`.
2. Execute the Python script using the terminal:

```bash
python3 FILENAME.py -v

## Running tests
Each module includes tests that are executed by the __main__ section of the module itself. To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
python3 FILENAME.py

Replace FILENAME.py with the specific Python file you want to test.

## Chapter Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, mirroring the book's structure. Inside each chapter's directory, you will find the relevant Python files. Feel free to explore the code and learn more about effective Python programming using the principles and techniques presented in Fluent Python 2nd Edition. Happy coding!
